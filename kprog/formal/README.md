# Native simulator verification

Safety uses two facts: the stock verifier accepts B, and B faithfully simulates
P. This directory proves generic simulator and token laws; native-link
preservation lives in [tv/](../tv/). The current
[coverage ledger](../results/kprog_verification_20261107/README.md) records every
operation/token, its exact theorem domain, replay source epoch and remaining
implementation interface. It currently records72 x86-64 C-model token-body equalities and74 of74
AArch64 operation bodies, plus two returning-helper interface equalities. LDADD/STADD0x46, LDSET/STSET0x47 and LDCLR/STCLR0x48 share canonical atomic access, typed success laws and unified token bindings. Full ISA and compiled-simulator closure remain active work.

## Specification and proof scope

The reference ISA is defined once in
[Reference/X86.lean](KProgFormal/Reference/X86.lean) and
[Reference/AArch64.lean](KProgFormal/Reference/AArch64.lean), with shared
[memory, permissions, initialization and ordered effects/faults](KProgFormal/Reference/Memory.lean).
These definitions cite Intel/Arm sources and are independent of generated
implementation contracts. [ReferenceMain.lean](ReferenceMain.lean) executes
these same definitions through JSON for hardware and artifact comparisons.
The [Arm ASL state comparison](../results/kprog_verification_20261107/reference-arm-asl.md)
records5016 agreeing observations across74 operation labels and explicit STLXR
monitor profiles. LDADD adds1344 agreeing cases and stated atomic/compiler premises. It retains its source/binary
identities and platform premises alongside the [x86 Sail comparison](../results/kprog_verification_20261107/reference-x86-sail.md),
which, together with the [direct ACL2 comparison](../results/kprog_verification_20261107/reference-x86-acl2.md),
records52 agreeing operation labels,14 model-stopped labels and an explicit
REP comparison difference with separate CPU evidence.

Handler/dispatcher and specialized-token laws compose modeled registers,
PC, ordered memory effects, faults and defined architectural outputs under
their stated operand, address, access and platform premises. Undefined outputs
use the reference step's observation mask; uninitialized memory has arbitrary
values. The theorem statements and coverage rows give each operation's domain.
The x86 pointer bodies share the extended dispatcher and refine resolved moves
for all sixteen registers, including the RSP coordinate. Native symbol/helper
address transport remains an explicit interface. Four memory-call token bodies
include sequential byte effects and the fresh caller-clobber frame; their
native call/ABI and physical memory relations remain explicit. Two helper token
wrappers prove full64-bit sparse ID routing, pre-call capture, result/memory/events
and fresh caller/callee-frame laws over a returning helper-effect interface;
typed arguments, native ABI and successful tail transfer remain explicit. Internal
RET includes its finite continuation switch; outer invocation/return-slot,
physical memory/provenance and C/compiler correspondence remain explicit.

Architectural profiles are stated in the reference and theorem premises:
x86 near control uses 48/57-bit canonical addresses with CET disabled, and
LEAVE uses the LASS-disabled frame profile. ARM uses the Cortex-A72 base
profile with explicit SP alignment, pair-access granularity and exclusive
monitor/order inputs. Each dynamic exclusive attempt receives its own
possible failure outcome. Concurrent memory behavior retains its physical
profile obligations. The safety argument uses generic simulator, token and
link-transformation theorems; historical per-program artifacts stay frozen.

The typed byte atomic kfunc C model now composes ADD/SET/CLR operand truncation,
old-value return and one-byte state commit through the unified dispatcher.
Primitive ordering, kfunc identity/call ABI and compiler transport remain explicit.

The read-only helper return also composes its valid-cell stack-tag map with the
full return observation. Its index origin and signed below-SP policy are proved;
physical frame ownership, helper effects/provenance and ABI remain explicit.

## Trusted boundary

The boundary includes Lean's kernel/toolchain and executable reduction bridge
(`Lean.ofReduceBool`), contract generation and C/Lean correspondence, native
decoding/encoding, and the C/BPF compilation path. Entry ABI, physical
memory/provenance, exclusive monitor/order/site identity and native address
transport are caller/platform interfaces. The ledger distinguishes proved
model laws, finite oracle/hardware evidence and complete-check outcomes.
The generic readonly finite-case law also composes object identity and shifted
aliases with canonical memory reads; final byte transfer transports its frozen
image premise. Every permitted canonical guest write preserves the frozen
image and its write permissions. Physical symbol/map lifetime, helper/platform
state effects and C/compiler transport stay explicit.
The private-spill projection also proves actual decoded STXDW/LDXDW pair execution,
whole BPF register/input-frame and public-memory preservation, and exact owned
event erasure for every signed16-bit offset. Compiler layout, intervening-body
control/liveness and physical frame/ABI correspondence remain explicit.
[Composition](../tv/Composition.lean) and the
[artifact work](../tv/README.md) track the generic link/compiler obligations.

## Run

```sh
make -C kprog/formal check
```

Use an x86-64 Linux host with BMI1/BMI2 and POPCNT, Lean/Elan, Python3,
Rust/Cargo, a C compiler with UBSan, clang 18/LLVM 18, GNU objdump,
AArch64 cross-GCC, QEMU user emulation, and the vendor/libbpf and
vendor/linux-framework submodules. This entry point builds all Lean modules,
checks generated contracts and proof hygiene, and runs retained semantic C
oracles and executable-reference comparisons. The existing compiled CMOV unit covers all16 conditions and16/32/64 widths
through decoded clang bytes, arbitrary fresh inputs and whole-memory preservation;
its scalar-register mapping and invocation interface remain explicit. Existing build caches are reused. Generator checks compare locked numeric contracts
and generated artifacts; compiled oracles exercise the current production bodies.
The dated ledger retains exact source hashes, commands and original outcomes.

## Layout

- [Reference/](KProgFormal/Reference/): canonical ISA and memory specifications.
- [contracts/](contracts/), [generated/](generated/) and
  [Generated/](KProgFormal/Generated/): JSON inputs and generated C/Lean contracts.
- [KProgFormal/](KProgFormal/) and [Refinement/](KProgFormal/Refinement/):
  primitives, full-state refinements, dispatcher/token and environment laws.
- [oracles/](oracles/): retained semantic C oracles.
- [tools/](tools/): generators and semantic tooling.
  build/ and .lake/ hold incremental outputs.
