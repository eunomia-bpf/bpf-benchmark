# Native-simulator formal model

This directory contains the first machine-checked refinement slice shared by
the x86-64 and AArch64 native simulators. Run it with:

```sh
make check
```

`KProgFormal.TagErasure` models a bounded fragment drawn from the simulators:
a 64-bit move, a pointer-shaped 64-bit add, an x86-shaped scalarizing integer
multiply-immediate, and a 64-bit load of the packet or packet-end pointer from
the simulator entry ABI. It proves for any sequence of those abstract
operations that:

1. erasing verifier-facing provenance tags yields the same bits as a pure
   modulo-2^64 architectural execution; and
2. tag transitions follow a separately declared provenance policy.

The pointer-add transition is generated from `ptr_add_spec.json` into both the
Lean model and the C macro used by the x86-64 non-stack LEA and AArch64
non-scalar ADD handler branches. The entry-ABI provenance policy is likewise
generated from `abi_load_spec.json`: it distinguishes XDP from `__sk_buff`,
maps only the architecture-independent `data` and `data_end` offsets to packet
tags, and scalarizes all other 64-bit ABI loads. Compile-time assertions bind
those offsets to both C ABI structs, while the Lean theorem compares the
generated transition against an independently written tag specification.
The complete AArch64 condition-code table is generated from
`arm64_cond_spec.json` into the Lean model and the C branch handler. Lean proves
that all 15 supported predicates select the same next program counter as an
independent architectural condition specification, for either branch
direction.
The supported x86 condition-code table is likewise generated from
`x86_cond_spec.json` into the C simulator predicate and Lean. Lean proves the
same next-PC refinement for arbitrary flags and branch targets; parity
conditions are outside the accepted simulator subset.
The legal x86 width encodings, masks, bit counts, narrowing, and zero/sign
observations are generated into the actual C helpers and Lean. Lean checks
their per-width model against an independent enumeration, while C static
assertions bind the numeric encodings. The x86 logical-result flag
transition is also generated into C and Lean. Its
composition theorem covers `CF=OF=0`, `ZF=zero`, and `SF=sign` through the
condition-to-next-PC decision using those observations.
The x86 subtraction flag transition is generated into the central C handler
and Lean. For already narrowed operands/result and a width sign mask, Lean
checks carry/borrow, zero, sign, and signed-overflow flags against an
independent specification and composes them through the condition-to-next-PC
theorem.
The x86 addition flag transition follows the same binding: for arbitrary
already-narrowed operands/result and a sign mask, the shared C/Lean contract
defines carry, zero, sign, and signed overflow and composes them through the
next-PC theorem. It does not prove that the supplied result was produced by
architectural addition.
All five x86 binary SBB operand-form handlers now obtain `a-b-borrow` from one shared
C/Lean expression contract. Lean proves its 64-bit modular result and the
per-width narrowing of that result against independent specifications. This
closes the earlier supplied-result premise for those handler expressions. A
separate generated SBB flag contract covers borrow-in, zero, sign, and overflow
and composes the result/subtrahend/narrowing layers as well as the next-PC
decision. Decoder selection and sign-mask derivation remain open.
The five x86 ADC binary operand forms use a dedicated generated result and
flag contract. This preserves carry-in through width overflow instead of
folding it into an ordinary ADD operand, and Lean composes modular
`a+b+carry`, per-width narrowing, ADC flags, and next-PC. Decoder selection and
sign-mask derivation remain outside the theorem.
Plain ADD in the central ALU result helper is the zero-carry specialization of
the same generated modular-addition contract. Lean composes that concrete
result, per-width narrowing, and the existing ADD flag transition, eliminating
ADD's earlier free-result premise while retaining decoder/compiler boundaries.
Plain SUB in the central ALU result helper similarly specializes the generated
SBB result contract to `borrow=false`. Lean composes that concrete result,
per-width narrowing, the width-derived sign mask, and the SUB flag transition;
comparison instructions and decoder/compiler boundaries are not covered by
this central-helper theorem. The five compare operand forms separately use the
same generated zero-borrow result and SUB flags contracts; Lean composes that
width-aware compare transition through the condition-to-next-PC decision.
The same generated width contract now supplies the sign-bit mask used by the
C ADD, SUB, ADC, and SBB flag wrappers. The width-aware ADD, ADC, and SBB step
theorems derive that mask from operand width rather than accepting a free
`sign` argument, and Lean checks that mask testing equals the independent sign
observation for every legal width. Decoder-to-handler and C-to-Lean language
correspondence remain boundaries.
The 16 accepted ALU mnemonics and numeric operation codes are generated into
the proof-artifact encoder's Python mapping, the C simulator constants, and
Lean. Lean checks both fields against an independent enumeration. This binds an
already parsed mnemonic to the C ALU code consumed by the handlers; objdump,
assembly parsing, operand-form selection, and handler semantics outside the
separately proved operations remain boundaries.
INC and DEC in the central result helper specialize the generated ADD and SBB
contracts to one and zero carry/borrow. Lean composes each modular result with
width narrowing, the generated ADD/SUB flags, explicit preservation of the
incoming CF, and condition-to-next-PC. This covers register and memory unary
handler values, but not memory access/store or decoder selection.
NEG likewise specializes the generated SBB result to `0-a` with no incoming
borrow and composes the SUB flags through next-PC. Unlike INC/DEC, its CF is
the architectural borrow from zero rather than a preserved input flag; memory
access/store and decoder selection remain outside the theorem.
NOT uses a generated bitwise-result and flag-preservation contract in the
central C handlers and Lean. Lean proves its width-narrowed result and that all
four incoming flags, including flags observed by the next condition, remain
unchanged. Register and memory-unary values are covered; memory access/store,
operand selection, and native compilation remain boundaries.
The x86 shift-count mask is generated into the central C helper and Lean.
Lean proves that its bit mask equals the architectural modulo-32 count for
8/16/32-bit operands and modulo-64 count for 64-bit operands, and proves the
corresponding count bound. Shift results and flags remain separate obligations.
SHL, SHR, SAR, and ROL results are generated into the central C result helper
and Lean. The independent Lean specification uses fixed-width bit vectors and
checks every width and masked count, including narrowing before SHR and
width-local sign fill for SAR. This fixes the prior narrow-width SHR/SAR result
errors. Operand selection, writeback, flags, and native compilation remain
outside these result theorems; SHLD and SHRD are separate operations.
Their flag transition is now generated into the central C handler and Lean as
well. For arbitrary operands, supplied result, incoming flags, legal width, and
masked count, Lean checks every architecturally defined field: count zero
preserves all flags; SHL/SHR/SAR update zero and sign, update carry while the
count is below the operand width for SHL/SHR or with sign saturation for SAR,
and define overflow at masked count one; ROL
preserves zero/sign, updates carry for every nonzero masked count, and defines
overflow at masked count one. The carry rule fixes the
prior 8/16-bit ROL case where a
nonzero masked count equal to the width left carry stale even though the
effective rotate amount was zero. The step theorems compose these flag
obligations with the independent shift-result theorems. SHL/SHR carry at or
beyond the operand width and overflow outside masked count one remain
intentionally unconstrained ISA fields; the generated C/Lean implementation's
deterministic choices for those fields are not claimed as architectural
guarantees.
Register writeback is generated from a shared C/Lean contract as well. Lean
checks an independent bit-update formulation for all four legal widths: a
low-byte 8-bit write and a low-word 16-bit write preserve the old upper bits,
32-bit writes zero-extend, and 64-bit writes replace the register. Every
integer-width write scalarizes simulator provenance.
The generated macros are used by the central C register switch for all 16
general-purpose registers; compile-time assertions bind its union and pointer
sizes and little-endian partial-write layout. The theorem covers the writeback
primitive, not selection of a destination register by a decoded instruction.
The generated primitive also accepts the high-byte lane used by AH/BH/CH/DH.
Lean proves the lane-parametric write and retains the concrete review
counterexample: writing `0xaa` into the high byte of `0x1122334455667788`
produces `0x112233445566aa88`. This primitive theorem alone does not bind
artifact metadata to a handler; the named integrated handlers below add that
composition, while unlisted handlers remain separate obligations. The C
compatibility convention that width zero aliases 64 and behavior for other
invalid numeric widths remain outside the typed Lean model.
Register operand reads now have the matching generated lane contract. Lean
proves that low/high byte observations and low 16/32/64-bit observations agree
with an independent fixed-width extraction specification, including a
concrete AH read regression. The existing full-register C read goes through
this generated primitive at width 64; passing decoded width/lane metadata in
the remaining unlisted operand handlers is still an integration obligation.
For MOV-immediate, MOV-register, register SETcc, register-destination
ADD/ADC/SUB/SBB, register CMP/TEST, and register NOT, a generated 32-bit AUX
layout now carries
the payload plus destination/source byte-lane shifts from the Python artifact
encoder into the C handler. Lean proves all three fields round-trip without
overlap for arbitrary values and both typed lanes; C static assertions bind
the same layout. The pre-existing `mov [mem], ah/bh/ch/dh` source-lane encoding
remains supported; other high-byte operand forms fail during artifact
generation instead of silently being treated as low-byte operands. This does
not cover other ALU operations, compare/ALU memory forms, extend, shift,
memory-load, or specialized handlers.
Register ADD now consumes that lane metadata in both generated C execution
paths. The corresponding Lean handler theorem composes lane-aware destination
and source reads, generated ADD result and flags, and lane-aware writeback for
all widths and lane choices. ADC has the same composed lane theorem, with the
incoming CF captured from the pre-state, and is enabled by the artifact
encoder. SUB now also composes generated subtraction with lane reads and
writeback. SBB likewise consumes the pre-state CF as borrow in its generated
result and flags before lane writeback. CMP composes the selected register
operands with generated subtraction flags and proves that destination bits and
tag are unchanged. TEST composes the selected operands with the generated
logic flags and proves the same destination preservation. The theorems do not
cover immediate decoding, instruction dispatch, compiler output, or native
bytes.
Register NOT also consumes the lane AUX through the shared unary C handler.
Its Lean handler theorem composes lane observation, the generated complement,
selected-lane writeback, scalarized provenance, and preservation of all four
modeled flags. Register INC now has the same lane-aware composition for its
generated increment result and writeback, including preservation of the
incoming carry flag. Register DEC likewise composes the generated decrement,
selected-lane writeback, and incoming carry preservation. Register NEG
composes subtraction from zero with selected-lane writeback and replacement
arithmetic flags. These register-unary operations now support high-byte lanes.
The ADD, ADC, SUB, and SBB register-handler slice then composes the generated
result, width narrowing, flag transition, and register writeback contracts.
For arbitrary old destination bits and tags, right-hand operand, incoming
flags, and legal width, Lean checks the resulting destination bits/tag and all
four modeled flags against an independently assembled handler specification.
This original composition covers the common register writeback reached after
operands are supplied. The lane-specific theorems above additionally refine
register operand observation and high-byte writeback for their named
operations; neither set proves instruction dispatch, immediate decoding, or
memory read/write handlers.
Arithmetic-immediate consumption now has a shared generated C/Lean contract:
the artifact field is reduced to 32 bits and sign-extended only for 64-bit
operations. Lean proves that bitwise implementation against an independent
`BitVec` truncate/sign-extend specification for every raw field and legal
width. This covers the C immediate helper after an encoded field is supplied;
it does not yet prove textual parsing or compose the decoded value through
each opcode handler.
`make check` rejects stale generated outputs before checking the theorem. This
mechanically binds the pointer-add bits/tag policy and ABI-load offset/tag
policy, both ISA flag-to-control-flow decisions, x86 width narrowing, and x86
logical/ADD/SUB/ADC/SBB flag production; other flag production, the decoder-to-handler
mapping, renderer, C compiler, and all other
operations remain in the trusted computing base.
The correspondence between C unsigned bit operations and Lean `BitVec`
operations remains a trusted language-semantics premise; these theorems do not
verify the C compiler or native instruction bytes.

This is still a deliberately bounded proof. It does not establish full
equivalence between the model and the C macro implementations, cover memory,
branches, helpers, or the full workload-derived instruction subsets, or prove
the paper's complete O1--O4 obligations. In particular, the multiply model is
x86-shaped, and the ABI-load model still abstracts away base-register identity,
width checks, and memory-boundary checks.
